"""Variables:
These are the named memory location inside python."""

# Named memory location:
'''1. Named: Variables have a unique name.
        No two or more variable can have the same name.'''
'''2. memory location: Variables occupy a particular space in the memory.
        On creation variables are allocated a particular space in the memory'''

# Naming conventions for variables.
'''
Variables names consist of:
1. Alphabets.
2. Numbers.
3. Underscore(_) as the only special character.

Variables name should start with:
1. Alphabets
2. underscore(_)
But not, Numbers.
'''
Variable1 = "valid"
variable1 = "valid"
_variable1 = "valid"
Variable_1 = "valid"

# 1_variable = "not valid" as starting with numbers
# variable@ = "not valid" as contains invalid characters.

# On upcoming lessons we will deal with scope of the variables
